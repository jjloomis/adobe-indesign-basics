# Creating a new Document

1. A New Document dialog box should appear when you open InDesign. If a New Document dialog box does not appear, go to File and select New and then Document from the flyout menu.
2. In the New Document dialog box, enter the measurements you will be using for your project. (Note: Measurement units will appear in picas. You can enter measurements in inches (.25in, for example) and then press Tab on your keyboard. This will convert inches to picas. When finished, click OK.
