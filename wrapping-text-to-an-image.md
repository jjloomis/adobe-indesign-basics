# Wrapping Text to an Image

To wrap text to image, the image must have a transparent background or the image must have a background color that matches the page color in InDesign \(a white background in the image and a white page in InDesign, for example.\)

1. Position an image over a text box.
2. Change the [stacking order](/changing-object-stacking-order.md) of the image so it is beneath the text box. \(Note: Leave the image selected after doing this.\)
3. With the image selected, go to **Window** on the menu bar and select **Text Wrap**.
4. In the **Text Wrap** window, click the **Wrap around object shape** button.
5. In the Contour Options drop down list, select **Detect Edges**.
