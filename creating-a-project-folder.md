## Creating a project folder

Before starting an InDesign project, you'll need to create a project folder. All media files associated with your project will live in this project folder with your InDesign project file \(INDD.\)

Never rename, move or delete the media files in your project folder. Your INDD file references these files. If your INDD file can't locate a media file, it will appear offline in your project.

1. Connect to your class folder using a JAMS Lab or Campus Computer Lab Mac.
2. Drill down in the folder tree until you are in your class folder.
3. Control-click in your class folder. In the fly-out menu, select New Folder.
4. Give this folder a new name using JAMS naming conventions.
